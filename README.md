# RxJS-timer

Implement a stopwatch that counts time in the "HH: MM: SS" format

The stopwatch must have the following buttons:

"Start / Stop" - start / stop timing, stops and resets the timer value.

"Wait" - works on a double click (the time between clicks is not more than 300 ms!); The timer must stop timing; if you press start after it, then the countdown is resumed.

"Reset" - resets the stopwatch to 0. Resets the stopwatch and starts counting again.
